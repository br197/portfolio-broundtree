## Hunch

I would like to explore how I might build a social media app for US immigrants to help them become acclimated to the US.

## Background

I am a leader for a community service organization (ITEC) that helps immigrants in the greater Boston with learning ESL and preparing for the citizenship exam. During our tutoring sessions, I've heard about their experiences and struggles navigating a new culture and language. So, I wanted to explore how social media could aid them in navigating life in the US.

## Meet the Interviewees

**Le-Thanh Nguyen**

Ms. Nguyen was born in 1967 in Vietnam. She immigrated to the US in 1993 while she was in her late 20s. She studied to be a civil engineering in Vietnam. However, when she came to the US she had to restart her educational journey and learn to navigate an environment that speaks English, a language she didn't understand prior to coming to the US. I picked Ms. Nguyen because she is an immigrant, which is my target audience, who came to the US within the working age (18-64 years old). Since, most immigrants come to the US as adults with 77% being within working age ([link](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states-2024#:~:text=The%20immigrant%20population's%20median%20age,median%20age%20of%2037%20years)), I felt like her experiences would capture some of the feelings, challenges, and life experiences most immigrants face today. Also, since Ms. Nguyen's age is close to the median age of the immigrant population in the US, 47 years old as of 2022, I felt like her experience using social media and the manner she uses it would reflect how other immigrants around her age range and generation (GenX) might utilize and navigate a social media platform. I also wanted to learn about why she adopted the various social media platforms she is on and how her social media adoption journey evolved from not using social media to increasingly engaging in social media groups and media feeds. 

**Le Phan**

Ms. Phan was born in 1944 in Vietnam. She immigrated to the US while she was in her late 40s. She worked as an accountant in Vietnam. However, when she came to the US she worked service jobs and learned basic English. I picked Ms. Phan because she came to the US in her late 40s, which is around the median age of immigrants coming to the US recently. I felt like I would be able to learn about the feelings life experiences, and culture shifts that immigrants coming to the US later-in-life experience. I was also intrigued by Ms. Phan as she is a part of the Tradionalists generation, a generation that is 4 away from mine. I thought it would be interesting to explore how she currently uses social media and gain her perspective on various topics such as privacy and social use cases. I wanted to also understand why she is using social media given she didn't grow up in a digital age and what prompted her to start engaging in social media.
