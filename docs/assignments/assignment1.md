## Hunch

I would like to explore how I might build a social media app for US immigrants to help them become acclimated to the US and find community.

## Background

I am a leader for a community service organization (ITEC) that helps immigrants in the greater Boston with learning ESL and preparing for the citizenship exam. During our tutoring sessions, I've heard about their experiences and struggles navigating a new culture and language. So, I wanted to explore how social media could aid them in navigating life in the US.

## Meet the Interviewees

**Le-Thanh Nguyen**

Ms. Nguyen was born in 1967 in Vietnam. She immigrated to the US in 1993 while she was in her late 20s. She studied to be a civil engineering in Vietnam. However, when she came to the US she had to restart her educational journey and learn to navigate an environment that speaks English, a language she didn't understand prior to coming to the US. I picked Ms. Nguyen because she is an immigrant, which is my target audience, who came to the US within the working age (18-64 years old). As written in ["Frequently Requested Statistics on Immigrants and Immigration in the United States"](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states-2024#:~:text=The%20immigrant%20population's%20median%20age,median%20age%20of%2037%20years), most immigrants come to the US as adults with 77% being within working age , I felt like her experiences would capture some of the feelings, challenges, and life experiences most immigrants face today. Also, since Ms. Nguyen's current age is close to the median age of the immigrant population in the US, 47 years old as of 2022, I felt like her experience using social media and the manner she uses it would reflect how other immigrants around her age range and generation (GenX) might utilize and navigate a social media platform. I also wanted to learn about why she adopted the various social media platforms she is on and how her social media adoption journey evolved from not using social media to increasingly engaging in social media groups and media feeds. 

**Le Phan**

Ms. Phan was born in 1944 in Vietnam. She immigrated to the US while she was in her late 40s. She worked as an accountant in Vietnam. However, when she came to the US she worked service jobs and learned basic English. I picked Ms. Phan because she came to the US in her late 40s, which is around the median age of immigrants coming to the US recently. I felt like I would be able to learn about the feelings, life experiences, and culture shifts that immigrants coming to the US later-in-life experience. I was also intrigued by Ms. Phan as she is a part of the Tradionalists generation, a generation that is 4 away from mine. I thought it would be interesting to explore how she currently uses social media and gain her perspective on various topics such as privacy and social media use cases. I wanted to also understand why she is using social media given she didn't grow up in a digital age and what prompted her to start engaging in social media.

## Le-Thanh's Interview Report
During her interview, Ms. Nguyen spoke about coming to the US and having to start over again in terms of her education, career, and language. She expressed how she had little support and faced challenges with daily tasks. One anecdote that stuck out to me was when she told me that she was living in Washington DC after coming from Vietnam and heard of a subway. She told me that she spent a while trying to find the subway for transportation because she wanted to travel but "only sees sandwich restaurants", referring to the Subway restaurant chain. This stuck out to me as she had expressed how she got some support from the church in ESL and other tasks, but there still seemed to be a lack of knowledge when it came to navigating practical daily tasks in the US. For help, she discussed how she mainly looked for people who were Vietnamese and would ask them questions to help her with her challenges, get through harships, do paperwork, and find jobs. I asked her why she specifically sought out Vietnamese people and she said it was partly because she would "belong to a group of people". She also mentioned it was because of a lower language barrier and higher chance for people to help her since they belong to the same community and may share immigration experiences. When I asked her how she would use social media if she had access to it when she came to the US, she stated that she would join online Vietnamese groups and ask a lot of questions. Her dialogue highlights the theme of community and its importance to immigrants when navigating a new country. This led me to think further about themes of comfort, shared experience, and language barriers when immigrants seek out assistance for acclimating to a new culture and country. 

We moved onto talking about her experience with social media. She talked about how social media was a part of her learning experience living in the US. When I asked her to share how she uses Facebook, her primary social media platform, I was intrigued by how she would take a screenshot of Facebook posts and save it to her camera roll to keep it in one place. She not only saved these posts to her camera roll, but would go back and write down its content into a notebook. I didn't understand why she would do this when Facebook has a save feature, but upon going through Facebook myself I found that the save feature button was hard to find. I was also intrigued by how she described Facebook as a "collection of people's wisdom for her". She describes how she joins various groups to gain knowledge about different topics and "to see what people are talking about". Through her saving posts in various locations and segmenting her knowledge sources into groups, I noticed a theme of grouping in her social media use and in the information she collected from social media. Lastly, in conversating about privacy and misinformation she stated that she had little concern and would use her judgement, however, she mentioned how Facebook groups help with that by asking questions before a person is able to join a group.

## Le Phan's Interview Report

During her interview, Ms. Phan spoke about coming to the US and how she struggled with learning English and navigating life tasks such as going to the doctor and how to get transportation such as a taxi to go places. The anecdotes that she shared about going to the doctor and not knowing how to articulate herself and having trouble obtaining transportation stuck out to me. Through my continued conversation with her, I learned that her acclimation to the US seemed to mainly focused on the ESL part, but other important aspects such as how to navigate errands and other practical tasks were left to her to figure out.

 She primarily uses social media to learn how to cook, connect with friends and relatives overseas for free, and share memories. She states, "I build my own quiet community, but I know I belong to a community and am happy" and how social media helps her "stay connected to the outside world" as an older person with limited English. Her dialogue reaffirmed my prior konwledge that use cases of social media is to stay connected with others and gain knowledge. She mainly engages in content that is Vietnamese, as it is easier to understand, and writes information she finds in videos in a book to save information. This dialogue intrigued me because like in my prior interview with Ms. Nguyen, she also tends to associate with those from her ethnicity and saves content through writing rather than using online save features. While she walked me through how she uses social media, she seemed to take a more passive approach when engaging with social media content. She didn't comment on posts because she was unsure how to ask questions online. In regards to privacy, she stated that she doesn't know much about privacy, so she's not worried about it. This surprised me because from my past observations, older folks are often more skeptical of new technologies and themes such as privacy, however Ms. Phan exhibited the opposite, potentially due to her passive use of social media.

## Design Features

**Barrier to Entry to Groups**
- Opportunity: One of the interviews highlighted how they liked how other social media apps had features that required users to state a reason before joining a group. There's an opportunity to create commonality in communities within the app by making users answer a couple of questions on their intentions for joining a group. 

- Why is it worth it: It helps maintain privacy within groups by making them exclusive to people who share common interests and intentions. Users would also be able to ensure that the groups that they are joining are focused on specific topics or involve people connected by certain relationships/experiences.

**Topic-based Forums**
- Opportunity: The interviews highlighted a tendency to seek out content pertaining to specific topics via online groups or genres of media and the desire to ask questions to others in similar communities. There's opportunity to break up content based on specific topic types (ie transportation, job finding, etc) so that immigrant users can ask questions pertaining to a specific topic and scroll feeds that have relevant content.

- Why it matters: There would be more organization of information on the app and allow for users to better search/raise questions they may have depending on which group feed they are looking at.

**Accessible UI**
- Opportunity: The interviews highlighted unconventional collection of information from social media platforms (via screenshotting and writing information in notebooks) versus using the platform's built in save feature. There's opportunity to make icons for content saving more visible rather than being in hidden menus.

- Why it matters: Immigrants and those learning new information often like to save information for future reference. A more visible save feature would allow saved information to be stored in-app and helps older users understand how to navigate the app if they wanted to save content.

**Forum Searching**
- Opportunity: The interviews highlighted searching for specific terms/names to be directed to people and related content (ie "Vietnamese" to be directed to Vietnamese users or groups). There is an opportunity for users to search for specific key terms to see what groups,topics,related content,etc. is available on the app.

- Why it matters: It provides users the ability to see their options when it comes to which groups they can join/content they can explore on the app.
