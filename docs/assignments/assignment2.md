# Assignment 2: Divergent Design

## App Name: 
HelloUSA

## Intended Audience
US immigrants in the working age range (18+)

## Value of App
HelloUSA offers immigrants the opportunity to both learn about resources within the US that can help them acclimate to a new country, but also the opportunity to form communities and ask questions to others to support each other in navigating a new country. Other apps catered to immigrants are either focused on helping them find resources and services, such as ESL classes, or helping immigrants chat with relatives and others in their communities overseas, but not both.

        <td>
            <img src="/assets/images/facebookgroups.png" width=400 height=400>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> On Facebook, users are suggested people to add as friends in a "People you may know" section based on if they have mutual friends or are a relatively small degree of separation from each other.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> I could use the idea of tracking and recommending relationships between users to introduce immigrant users to people they may know or are of smaller degrees of separation from each other. This could help users build community and facilitate networking with people who share mutual connections.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> On Facebook, in order to join certain groups, once a user clicks to join a group they are prompted to fill out a questionnaire stating their intents and why they want to join the Facebook group.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> I could use the idea of intent forms to provide a barrier of entry to user communities within HelloUSA to try to reduce users with mal-intents from joining communities and to ensure communities are made up of people interested in participating in it.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> On the USAHello app, there is a map that has pins placed on it detailing where nearby physical resources are, in this case healthcare and counseling, based on your location.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> I could use a similar map interface in HelloUSA to help users find information about physical resources near them such as where transportation modes and ESL classes are. This would provide users with a visual of where and how many resources are near them which could be easier to understand rather than giving the information in a text document. I could also utilize a similar resource category breakdown as USAHello to cover the main areas of resources an immigrant may need.</p>

            <img src="/assets/images/redditcomm.png" width=400 height=400>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> On Reddit, community pages display a forum style interface made up of user posts and discussion threads with the title of posts bolded.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> Based on my needfinding interviews, the ability to ask many questions about various topics and to learn from others was emphasized as a desire of my interviewees. I could use the idea of posts and discussion threads to provide a means for users to ask questions and discuss in threads to facilitate back and forth communication and question answering.</p>

            <img src="/assets/images/redditgroups.png" width=400 height=400>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> On Reddit, communities are organized by categories and users can join a wide variety of groups based on their interests in these categories.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> I like the interface that Reddit uses to display the diverse options users have for communities to join. The layout is easy to read and very clean for easy use by users and there is a potential for integrating filters for users to only view communities from a specific category if they wanted to.</p>

            <img src="/assets/images/verify.png" width=400 height=400>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> On LinkedIn, users can opt to verify their identity and will receive a check mark badge once they pass verification of who they say they are.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> I could use the idea of identity verification to ensure that users are real people and to increase the security on the app and trust that the information users are receiving is from a real entity.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> In both my needfinding interviews, my intereviewees expressed how they liked to save the content they consumed in one place (photos, writing it down in a book, etc.). I could use the idea of storing saved posts in a central location to enhance organization and access of saved content.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> I could use the idea of grouping saved posts to allow HelloUSA users to curate the organization of the content they save to their preferences and to reduce clutter.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> I could use a similar idea to karma to encourage users to participate in HelloUSA communities and add credibility to users who participate frequently and make agreeable post. Since there is a lot of information transfer when posts are made, it is important to ensure that the posts are made by someone with a history of trust and doing good in the community.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Design Brainstorming:</strong> I could use a similar feed structure by still having a main feed where users receive recommended content, but also a community focused feed that only shows content from the communities users are in. This provides a users the option to see new content in a more general main feed but also see a more specific feed based on their communities.</p>

## Feature Ideas
*Did some collaborative brainstorming with Israel Wong

1. Flag Identifiers

The flag of the users' country is displayed on their profile so users are able to easily find others who come from the same country as them and most likely speak their language.

2. Verification Check Tag

A indicator visible on a user's profile that represents that the user has provided their government ID to verify they are a real person to enhance authenticity and security on the app.

3. Karma Points

Points that are awarded to users when they interact with posts or make posts of their own that are well-intended to encourage users to be active on the app by asking and answering questions as well as make sure users are posting content that is credible and agreeable.

4. Group Intent Evaluation

Users are prompted to answer a short questionnaire about their intent on joining a community within the app to reduce the number of mal-intended users joining communities and to ensure communities are built witha member base that is truly interested in their purpose.

5. Saved Content Groupings

Content that users save are stored in one location and users have the ability to organization the content as they wish by grouping content (ie saved posts, resources, etc).

6. Location + Flag Filtering

A search filter that allows users to view other users that come from their country and live in nearby areas.

7. Personalized Milestones

A checklist for milestones such as the driver's exam, getting a job, etc. that users can check complete to earn badges.

8. AI Quick Answers

An AI chatbot that can provide quick answers to users' questions in the case that a user's questions hasn't been answered for a while or they don't want to wait for someone to respond.

9. Resources Map

A map that displays nearby resources (as pins on the map) in various domains such as healthcare, legal, ESL classes, job centers, etc. so immigrants know where to find resources near them.

10. Multilingual Translations

Users can receive resource information and post content in their respective languages to reduce the language barrier when trying to ask questions and learning from answers to those questions.

11. Community Groups

Users can join groups based on their respective countries, hobbies/interests, location, etc. to meet other immigrants who share commonalities with them and to build a support system.

12. Knowledge Hub

Users can share resources that they have used to learn about the US (ie ESL resources, guides, etc.) to provide another mode of answering other users' questions and to foster a giving community.

13. Upvoting

Users can upvote questions to make relatable questions more visible in discussion threads and can upvote resources as well to indicate how helpful the resource is.

14. Discussion Threads

Users can make posts and other users can respond to these posts to keep an ongoing conversation around a question a user asks. This allows users to ask follow up questions and provide new insights after the initial post is made.

15. Opportunity Board

Users can post about various opportunities on a specialized board such as job openings, events, etc. that can be helpful to the greater community.

16. People Recommendations

Users are recommended to other users if they come from the same country, live in nearby locations, or share mutual connections with other users. 

17. Private Messaging

Users are able to communicate with other users individually to share information or discuss without their conversations being displayed on public discussion forums.

18. Mentor Matching

Users who have been in the US for a while can sign up to be matched to a user who has recently gotten to the US and lives in their area to chat about navigating the US.

19. Anniversaries

When the user has been on the app for 1 year, they will get a notification about their 1 year anniversary on HelloUSA and same for each subsequent year.

20. User Compatibility

Users are able to specify what they are looking for in using HelloUSA and match with people with similar aspirations.

## VSD Analysis

### Stakeholders

a). ***Observation: Stakeholders - Variation in Human Ability*** HelloUSA's resource map (Feature 9) feature may be tough to navigate for someone who has visual impairments, especially if there are multiple location pins clustered together. The map can also be difficult for someone who has limited motor control as zooming in/out and scrolling through the map could be difficult.

b). ***Design Response:*** Provide an side bar option where users can scroll through the locations and view the same information displayed on the map to provide a UI that is easier to navigate for those with limited motor control and screen readers to read off the informational content.

### Time

a). ***Observation: Time - Choosing Not to Use HelloUSA*** HelloUSA features such as the discussion threads (Feature 14), community groups (Feature 11), and opportunity board (Feature 15) rely on user engagement to stay active with content. If users choose not to use aspects of the app, such as not answering questions, this could infringe on the app's purpose to facilitate community discussions.

b). ***Design Response:*** In my reflecting about my personal experiences running group ESL teaching sessions for immigrants and after doing some research [link](https://www.uxness.in/2014/12/14-reasons-why-people-like-more-than.html#:~:text=We%20comment%20if%20we%20are,motivated%20to%20comment%20or%20reply.), I found that people tend to engage more in discussions, ask questions, answer questions, etc. when they have a personal tie to what is being discussed and feel comfortable in the situation. The current community group feature helps to aggregate users who are interested in the topics of the discussion thread. In addition to this, there could be an additional feature to the community groups where users can respond to a daily question or have a daily challenge where they have a set number of posts they are encouraged to interact with (similar to how organizations such as Colorstack handle user engagement). 


a). ***Observation: Time - Less Diverse Relationships*** The ability for users to filter for people who share their same ethnicity, country, etc. (Feature 6) could inadvertently result in user creating less diverse communities and relationships with others as they look for those similar to themselves. 

b). ***Design Response:*** To help mitigate this, the people recommendation feature could be expanded to not only recommend people of the same background but also people who live nearby or are in similar community groups within HelloUSA to add variety to people's relationships on the app.

a). ***Observation: Time - The Long Now*** Users may stop using HelloUSA as they get more used to life in the US and don't need to ask as many questions anymore nor want to engage in question and answering anymore.

b). ***Design Response:*** Establish affinity community groups separate from the discussion community groups where users can talk about their hobbies and find a community outside of asking for assistance. Possibly provide a page that lists only affinity groups to join and another page to list only discussion groups to discuss.

### Values

a). ***Observation: Values - Sociability vs. Privacy*** HelloUSA aims to facilitate and encourage social interactions between immigrant users while also maintaining their privacy. However, through the social aspect of the app, the contents of posts and location filtering (Feature 6) could expose information that is sensistive to users. 


b). ***Design Response:*** The amount of information the user discloses is up to their discretion, however,there could be an addition of a opt-in and opt-out feature that allows users to opt-out of sharing their location.

a). ***Observation: Values - User Experience of Values Overwhelming*** One of the values of HelloUSA is to make resources more accessible and visible to immigrants. However, this may cause immigrant users to be overwhelmed with all the resources that are provided. (ie Feature 14 - Discussion Boards, Feature 9 - Resource Map, Feature 12 - Knowledge Hub)
 
b).***Design Response:*** Establish a resource walkthrough or tutorial when users join so they understand where resources are in the app. Could also organize resources separately into various tabs/windows to reduce clutter on the screen.

### Pervasiveness

a). ***Observation: Pervasiveness - Spread of misinformation from Widespread Use*** As more and more users join HelloUSA and create content, this may introduce harmful practices such as the spread of false information and hateful content in HelloUSA's discussion threads (Feature 14).

b). ***Design Response:*** Establish a moderation bot that will scan through posted content and take down posts that contain hateful language or false information.

## Sketches

### Goal: 

User wants to find ESL classes near them because they are having a hard time understanding English speakers and want more practice with the language

![picture description](/assets/images/hello_usa_get_resource.jpeg)

### Brittle/Unclear Observations:

Should resources of all types be displayed after a user enters their location, or should no resource be displayed and it is up to the user to select the resource type they want before resources are populated on the resource map.

### Goal: 

User has recently arrived to the US and wish they have resources to help them navigate a new country

![picture description](/assets/images/hello_usa_first_time.jpeg)

### Brittle/Unclear Observations:

What should the order of the account setup process be? The verification step seemed to be too late in the flow. May have to change the ordering of the steps to improve use experience in creating an account.
