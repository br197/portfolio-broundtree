# UI Design of Amazon

## Original Post

As we were going over the grid topic of lecture earlier this week, it made me think of online retail stores. In order to sell online products effectively, companies must pay attention to how these products are laid out on the page, how products relate to each other, and how users will navigate the product information on the page.

In this blog, I will analyze the information infrastructure and grid layout of the Amazon store.

Starting with the home page and throughout the other pages, Amazon does a good job with grouping similar elements in their page layout. For example, in the bottom left of the picture, items related to cars are grouped together in a grid of 4. Amazon also utilizes a unique way of grid layout to maximize the real estate they have on their web page. In class, we discussed utilizing spacing between grid boxes to differentiate sections on a page. Amazon also does this by spacing out the white grid boxes on the page to signify each box holds items of different genres. However, they also make use of color to also signal this differentiation. All the images in the carousel background have a color scheme that allows the white boxes that display products to pop out to the user still, but creates another “gridbox” that holds the information in the carousel.

One critique I have is with the typography layout of Amazon’s pages. Although Amazon does a pretty good job with the grid layout, by grouping each genre of products in grid boxes that spans most the page, the sidebar could cause cognitive overload as the departments are not adequately spaced. The tight space between the department titles makes it hard for the user to search for departments in the titles list at a glance and requires some precision in clicking to navigate to the correct department.

On the other hand, Amazon does a good job with differentiating categories in list formats in their footer. Using a similar model where typography is evenly spaced and possibly utilizing various font weights to headline product categories in the department title sidebar could help improve the usability and efficiency users are able to navigate through the sidebar menu (shown in picture above).
