# How 5 Minute Crafts Overcomes Design and Functional Fixation + The "Blank Slate" Problem

After yesterday’s lecture, I started thinking about design and functional fixation and how others have overcome it. While thinking about this, the infamous channel 5 Minute Crafts popped into my mind as this channel has gained a following of millions by challenging cognitive biases through using materials in many innovative ways.

**Overcoming Design and Functional Fixation**

The channel comes up with many life hack videos a week that showcase a large quantity of solutions to particular problems using unexpected materials. Some of these solution ideas have been found to not work, however the channel exemplifies generating a large quantity of ideas no matter their quality or how “unconventional” they are to solve a problem. 

For example, in one of their camping videos they utilized a lighter to be a duct tape holder and a compact candle. We’ve been taught that the function of a lighter is to light things on fire, but 5 Minute Crafts challenges this perceived function with conceptual variants. They utilize the base of the light to make the duct tape holder. In the candle case, we usually see candles and lighters as separate entities but 5 Minute Crafts combines the two by utilizing the base of the lighter along with other materials to serve as a candle and wick and sets the wick on fire using the lighter’s usual fire lighting functionality.

**The Blank Slate Problem**

Aside from overcoming cognitive biases, I infer that the 5 Minute Crafts channel staff follow some of the steps that we discussed to overcome the “Blank Slate” problem.

In order to generate the large amount of ideas they have per video and to continually produce the large number of videos they do per year, they most likely go through collaborative brainstorming sessions to answer the “How might we?” question when it comes to hacking a particular problem in their chosen settings. 

Each video they make also applies a constraint to narrow the scope of their ideas whether it be the narrow range of materials they can use, the setting they place the video in, or a combination of the two. 

Additionally, I infer that they use storyboarding behind-the-scenes to show how each of their innovative solutions fit into their setting and problem domain. For example, in the camping video case, alongside various others videos, they follow the structure of introducing a character in a setting, that they constrained the video to and introduce a problem, then they go into the sequence of steps on how they build out their solution to solve the problem using their constrained set of materials, and lastly show the character “satisfied” with using the innovative solution.
