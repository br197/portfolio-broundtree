# Passio Go UI Commentary

After attending this week’s UI design lecture, I was inspired to think about the technologies that I use on a daily basis and how their UI designs help (or disrupt) my user experience using them. One of the technologies that came to mind is Passio Go, the transit tracking app used by university students to track campus shuttles and where they are on their routes. 

Below I will analyze the app against some of the heuristic evaluation points presented in class. However, before I do so, I think it is important to remember the purpose of the app: to provide users with relevant transit tracking information, when analyzing the UI of an app.

**Ease of Use (Learnability):**

Passio Go’s interface for its baseline functionality is pretty intuitive and with repeated use, users should be able to discover most of its other functionality. The main functionality of the app is for transit tracking. The interface to track transit on the app is very clearly visible (it's the first thing users see) and once the user orients themselves on where they are on the map (see blue dot) and which stops the transit vehicles go to (see colored dots), the user will be able to use the app’s basic functionality. However, for the app’s other functionality, it can take a little bit of time to figure out. Most of the app’s other functionality are hidden in collapsed sidebars or menus. However, after taking the provided tutorial of the app and experimentally clicking buttons, the user should be able to get a good idea of how to use the other features of the app.

I think the most hidden feature (and sometimes confusing) is how to get the arrival times of the vehicle. Users would need to play around with the app and stumble upon clicking onto one of the stops (colored dots) to discover the app’s functionality of being able to report the ETA of each shuttle that runs through each stop, bus number, and stop information.


**Mapping:**

I think Passio Go does a good job of laying out its interface to match its function. Upon entering the app, the user is presented with a map of their surrounding area filled with color coded routes and icons that represent transit vehicles rather than presenting something like a list of transit vehicles and their stops (ie [the MBTA bus site](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/bus)). This UI fits the apps purpose of displaying transit information because it does just that, it shows where the vehicles are and what routes they take.

**Typography:**

I really like the app’s use of color to differentiate the transit routes and how it associates information for each route with its color. The coloring creates consistency in the app (you see a color and know anything in that color belongs to route X) and creates color associations (mapping color to route/its information), making it more efficient for the user to identify routes and locate transit vehicles (and their stops). Users can just look for the color of their desired route on the home screen rather than having to click a stop to check if the transit vehicle goes to that stop or perform other additional actions to seek out the information they need.

With the color aspect of the app, it is important to keep in mind accessibility to ensure the color choices in the app and colored information is easily readable for those who are colorblind or see color in different ways.
